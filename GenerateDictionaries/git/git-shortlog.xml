</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>trailer:&lt;field&gt;</literal>, the <literal>&lt;field&gt;</literal> is interpreted as a case-insensitive
   commit message trailer (see <citerefentry>
<refentrytitle>git-interpret-trailers</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
</citerefentry>). For
   example, if your project uses <literal>Reviewed-by</literal> trailers, you might want
   to see who has been reviewing with
   <literal>git shortlog -ns --group=trailer:reviewed-by</literal>.
</simpara>
<simpara>Note that commits that do not include the trailer will not be counted.
Likewise, commits with multiple trailers (e.g., multiple signoffs) may
be counted more than once (but only once per unique trailer value in
that commit).</simpara>
<simpara>Shortlog will attempt to parse each trailer value as a <literal>name &lt;email&gt;</literal>
identity. If successful, the mailmap is applied and the email is omitted
unless the <literal>--email</literal> option is specified. If the value cannot be parsed
as an identity, it will be taken literally and completely.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If <literal>--group</literal> is specified multiple times, commits are counted under each
value (but again, only once per unique value in that commit). For
example, <literal>git shortlog --group=author --group=trailer:co-authored-by</literal>
counts both authors and co-authors.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>
        Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk
        reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones.
        When this option is used you cannot specify commits to
        exclude (that is, <emphasis>&#94;commit</emphasis>, <emphasis>commit1..commit2</emphasis>,
        and <emphasis>commit1...commit2</emphasis> notations cannot be used).
</simpara>
<simpara>With <literal>--pretty</literal> format other than <literal>oneline</literal> and <literal>reference</literal> (for obvious reasons),
this causes the output to have two extra lines of information
taken from the reflog.  The reflog designator in the output may be shown
as <literal>ref@{Nth}</literal> (where <literal>Nth</literal> is the reverse-chronological index in the
reflog) or as <literal>ref@{timestamp}</literal> (with the timestamp for that entry),
depending on a few rules:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
If the starting point is specified as <literal>ref@{Nth}</literal>, show the index
   format.
</simpara>

<simpara>
If the starting point was specified as <literal>ref@{now}</literal>, show the
   timestamp format.

If neither was used, but <literal>--date</literal> was given on the command line, show
   the timestamp in the format requested by <literal>--date</literal>.

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Otherwise, show the index format.
</simpara>
</listitem>

<simpara>Under <literal>--pretty=oneline</literal>, the commit message is

<simpara>A more detailed explanation follows.</simpara>
<simpara>Suppose you specified <literal>foo</literal> as the &lt;paths&gt;.  We shall call commits
that modify <literal>foo</literal> !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME.  (In a diff
filtered for <literal>foo</literal>, they look different and equal, respectively.)</simpara>
<simpara>In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
illustrate the differences between simplification settings.  We assume
that you are filtering for a file <literal>foo</literal> in this commit graph:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /   /
        I     B   C   D   E   Y
         \   /   /   /   /   /
          `-------------'   X</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge.  The commits are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>I</literal> is the initial commit, in which <literal>foo</literal> exists with contents
  &#8220;asdf&#8221;, and a file <literal>quux</literal> exists with contents &#8220;quux&#8221;. Initial
  commits are compared to an empty tree, so <literal>I</literal> is !TREESAME.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In <literal>A</literal>, <literal>foo</literal> contains just &#8220;foo&#8221;.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>B</literal> contains the same change as <literal>A</literal>.  Its merge <literal>M</literal> is trivial and
  hence TREESAME to all parents.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>C</literal> does not change <literal>foo</literal>, but its merge <literal>N</literal> changes it to &#8220;foobar&#8221;,
  so it is not TREESAME to any parent.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>D</literal> sets <literal>foo</literal> to &#8220;baz&#8221;. Its merge <literal>O</literal> combines the strings from
  <literal>N</literal> and <literal>D</literal> to &#8220;foobarbaz&#8221;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>E</literal> changes <literal>quux</literal> to &#8220;xyzzy&#8221;, and its merge <literal>P</literal> combines the
  strings to &#8220;quux xyzzy&#8221;. <literal>P</literal> is TREESAME to <literal>O</literal>, but not to <literal>E</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>X</literal> is an independent root commit that added a new file <literal>side</literal>, and <literal>Y</literal>
  modified it. <literal>Y</literal> is TREESAME to <literal>X</literal>. Its merge <literal>Q</literal> added <literal>side</literal> to <literal>P</literal>, and
  <literal>Q</literal> is TREESAME to <literal>P</literal>, but not to <literal>Y</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><literal>rev-list</literal> walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether <literal>--full-history</literal> and/or parent rewriting
(via <literal>--parents</literal> or <literal>--children</literal>) are used. The following settings
are available.</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Default mode
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent
        (though this can be changed, see <literal>--sparse</literal> below).  If the
        commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow
        only that parent.  (Even if there are several TREESAME
        parents, follow only one of them.)  Otherwise, follow all
        parents.
</simpara>
<simpara>This results in:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---N---O
         /     /   /
        I---------D</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed <literal>B</literal> from consideration entirely.  <literal>C</literal> was
considered via <literal>N</literal>, but is TREESAME.  Root commits are compared to an
empty tree, so <literal>I</literal> is !TREESAME.</simpara>
<simpara>Parent/child relations are only visible with <literal>--parents</literal>, but that does
not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--full-history without parent rewriting
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow
        all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them.
        Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are
        included, this does not imply that the merge itself is!  In
        the example, we get
</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara><literal>M</literal> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.  <literal>E</literal>,
<literal>C</literal> and <literal>B</literal> were all walked, but only <literal>B</literal> was !TREESAME, so the others
do not appear.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--full-history with parent rewriting
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
        (though this can be changed, see <literal>--sparse</literal> below).
</simpara>
<simpara>Merges are always included.  However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
themselves.  This results in</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /

         \   /   /   /   /
          `-------------'</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>Compare to <literal>--full-history</literal> without rewriting above.  Note that <literal>E</literal>
was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
rewritten to contain <literal>E</literal>'s parent <literal>I</literal>.  The same happened for <literal>C</literal> and
<literal>N</literal>, and <literal>X</literal>, <literal>Y</literal> and <literal>Q</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
affects inclusion:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--dense
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--sparse
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        All commits that are walked are included.
</simpara>
<simpara>Note that without <literal>--full-history</literal>, this still simplifies merges: if
one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other
sides of the merge are never walked.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--simplify-merges
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        First, build a history graph in the same way that
        <literal>--full-history</literal> with parent rewriting does (see above).
</simpara>
<simpara>Then simplify each commit <literal>C</literal> to its replacement <literal>C'</literal> in the final
history according to the following rules:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Set <literal>C'</literal> to <literal>C</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Replace each parent <literal>P</literal> of <literal>C'</literal> with its simplification <literal>P'</literal>.  In
  the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are
  root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take care
  to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If after this parent rewriting, <literal>C'</literal> is a root or merge commit (has
  zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains.
  Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
<literal>--full-history</literal> with parent rewriting.  The example turns into:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M---N---O
         /     /       /
        I     B       D
         \   /       /
          `---------'</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>Note the major differences in <literal>N</literal>, <literal>P</literal>, and <literal>Q</literal> over <literal>--full-history</literal>:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>N</literal>'s parent list had <literal>I</literal> removed, because it is an ancestor of the
  other parent <literal>M</literal>.  Still, <literal>N</literal> remained because it is !TREESAME.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>P</literal>'s parent list similarly had <literal>I</literal> removed.  <literal>P</literal> was then
  removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>Q</literal>'s parent list had <literal>Y</literal> simplified to <literal>X</literal>. <literal>X</literal> was then removed, because it
  was a TREESAME root. <literal>Q</literal> was then removed completely, because it had one
  parent and is TREESAME.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>There is another simplification mode available:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--ancestry-path
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry
        chain between the &#8220;from&#8221; and &#8220;to&#8221; commits in the given commit
        range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the &#8220;to&#8221;
        commit and descendants of the &#8220;from&#8221; commit.
</simpara>
<simpara>As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">            D---E-------F
           /     \       \
          B---C---G---H---I---J
         /                     \
        A-------K---------------L--M</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>A regular <emphasis>D..M</emphasis> computes the set of commits that are ancestors of <literal>M</literal>,
but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <literal>D</literal>. This is useful to see
what happened to the history leading to <literal>M</literal> since <literal>D</literal>, in the sense
that &#8220;what does <literal>M</literal> have that did not exist in <literal>D</literal>&#8221;. The result in this
example would be all the commits, except <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> (and <literal>D</literal> itself,
of course).</simpara>
<simpara>When we want to find out what commits in <literal>M</literal> are contaminated with the
bug introduced by <literal>D</literal> and need fixing, however, we might want to view
only the subset of <emphasis>D..M</emphasis> that are actually descendants of <literal>D</literal>, i.e.
excluding <literal>C</literal> and <literal>K</literal>. This is exactly what the <literal>--ancestry-path</literal>
option does. Applied to the <emphasis>D..M</emphasis> range, it results in:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">                E-------F
                 \       \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>Before discussing another option, <literal>--show-pulls</literal>, we need to
create a new example history.</simpara>
<simpara>A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is that a
commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the file&#8217;s
simplified history. Let&#8217;s demonstrate a new example and show how options
such as <literal>--full-history</literal> and <literal>--simplify-merges</literal> works in that case:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-'`-Z'   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--'  `---Y--'</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>For this example, suppose <literal>I</literal> created <literal>file.txt</literal> which was modified by
<literal>A</literal>, <literal>B</literal>, and <literal>X</literal> in different ways. The single-parent commits <literal>C</literal>, <literal>Z</literal>,
and <literal>Y</literal> do not change <literal>file.txt</literal>. The merge commit <literal>M</literal> was created by
resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal>
and hence is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <literal>R</literal>, however, was
created by ignoring the contents of <literal>file.txt</literal> at <literal>M</literal> and taking only
the contents of <literal>file.txt</literal> at <literal>X</literal>. Hence, <literal>R</literal> is TREESAME to <literal>X</literal> but not
<literal>M</literal>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create <literal>N</literal> is to take the
contents of <literal>file.txt</literal> at <literal>R</literal>, so <literal>N</literal> is TREESAME to <literal>R</literal> but not <literal>C</literal>.
The merge commits <literal>O</literal> and <literal>P</literal> are TREESAME to their first parents, but
not to their second parents, <literal>Z</literal> and <literal>Y</literal> respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>When using the default mode, <literal>N</literal> and <literal>R</literal> both have a TREESAME parent, so
those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The resulting history
graph is:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">        I---X</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>When using <literal>--full-history</literal>, Git walks every edge. This will discover
the commits <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> and the merge <literal>M</literal>, but also will reveal the
merge commits <literal>O</literal> and <literal>P</literal>. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph is:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M--------N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-'`--'   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--'  `------'</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>Here, the merge commits <literal>O</literal> and <literal>P</literal> contribute extra noise, as they did
not actually contribute a change to <literal>file.txt</literal>. They only merged a topic
that was based on an older version of <literal>file.txt</literal>. This is a common
issue in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in
parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: manu
unrelated merges appear in the <literal>--full-history</literal> results.</simpara>
<simpara>When using the <literal>--simplify-merges</literal> option, the commits <literal>O</literal> and <literal>P</literal>
disappear from the results. This is because the rewritten second parents
of <literal>O</literal> and <literal>P</literal> are reachable from their first parents. Those edges are
removed and then the commits look like single-parent commits that are
TREESAME to their parent. This also happens to the commit <literal>N</literal>, resulting
in a history view as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M--.
         /     /    \
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--'</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes from
<literal>A</literal>, <literal>B</literal>, and <literal>X</literal>. We also see the carefully-resolved merge <literal>M</literal> and the
not-so-carefully-resolved merge <literal>R</literal>. This is usually enough information
to determine why the commits <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> "disappeared" from history in
the default view. However, there are a few issues with this approach.</simpara>
<simpara>The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
<literal>--simplify-merges</literal> option requires walking the entire commit history
before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to
use for very large repositories.</simpara>
<simpara>The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working
on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced
a change into an important branch. The problematic merge <literal>R</literal> above is
not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an
important branch. Instead, the merge <literal>N</literal> was used to merge <literal>R</literal> and <literal>X</literal>
into the important branch. This commit may have information about why
the change <literal>X</literal> came to override the changes from <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> in its
commit message.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>
        In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show
        each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but
        is TREESAME to a later parent.
</simpara>
<simpara>When a merge commit is included by <literal>--show-pulls</literal>, the merge is
treated as if it "pulled" the change from another branch. When using
<literal>--show-pulls</literal> on this example (and no other options) the resulting
graph is:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">        I---X---R---N</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>Here, the merge commits <literal>R</literal> and <literal>N</literal> are included because they pulled
the commits <literal>X</literal> and <literal>R</literal> into the base branch, respectively. These
merges are the reason the commits <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> do not appear in the
default history.</simpara>
<simpara>When <literal>--show-pulls</literal> is paired with <literal>--simplify-merges</literal>, the
graph includes all of the necessary information:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">          .-A---M--.   N
         /     /    \ /
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--'</literallayout><simpara></simpara>
<simpara>Notice that since <literal>M</literal> is reachable from <literal>R</literal>, the edge from <literal>N</literal> to <literal>M</literal>
was simplified away. However, <literal>N</literal> still appears in the history as an
important commit because it "pulled" the change <literal>R</literal> into the main
branch.</simpara>

</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>The <literal>--simplify-by-decoration</literal> option allows you to view only the
big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits
that are not referenced by tags.  Commits are marked as !TREESAME
(in other words, kept after history simplification rules described
above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the
contents of the paths given on the command line.  All other
commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).</simpara>
